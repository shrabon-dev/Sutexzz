# Sutexzz A Nuxt JS Application

Sutexzz is my first application built with Nuxt JS. I am currently learning Nuxt JS and using this project to enhance my skills.

The application consists of two main parts:

### Front End:  
This part is already completed and deployed. You can view it here: https://sutexzz.vercel.app/

### Admin Panel:
This part is currently in development. It will include:

- A design layout for the admin interface.

- Functionality for user authentication.

- Integration with third-party APIs.
